# Rock Paper Scissors Game

A browser-based Rock Paper Scissors game with an interactive UI and animated marquee winner display. Built as part of The Odin Project curriculum.

## Project Description

This is a simple yet engaging implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game. Players click on visual representations of rock, paper, or scissors to make their choice, and the computer randomly selects its move. The winner of each round is displayed in a scrolling marquee banner at the bottom of the screen.

## Features

- Interactive gameplay with clickable image buttons
- Computer opponent with random choice generation
- Animated marquee display showing round results
- Clean, grid-based layout with custom styling
- Instant feedback after each round
- Responsive design with custom typography

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (including CSS animations and Grid layout)
- Vanilla JavaScript (DOM manipulation and event listeners)
- Custom web fonts (Brunswick Grotesque)

## What I Learned

Through building this project, I developed skills in:

- **DOM Manipulation**: Selecting and updating HTML elements with JavaScript
- **Event Listeners**: Adding click events to multiple elements using `forEach` and `addEventListener`
- **CSS Animations**: Creating smooth scrolling marquee effects with `@keyframes`
- **JavaScript Functions**: Writing reusable functions with parameters and return values
- **Conditional Logic**: Implementing game rules with if/else statements
- **String Methods**: Using `.toLowerCase()`, `.repeat()`, and template literals
- **Math.random()**: Generating random choices for the computer player
- **Debugging**: Troubleshooting CSS and JavaScript issues through the browser console

## How to Run It

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser
3. Click on rock, paper, or scissors to play!
4. Watch the marquee banner to see if you won, lost, or tied

No installation or build process required - just open and play!
